//Any depedencies or 3 rd party libraries being used are to be included here, for example if
// a samplelibrary has to be included (P.S the library should be using the gradle build format)and
// is present in LibProjects at the application directory level the
// below line is to be added
//include ':LibProjects:samplelibrary'//comment out this line
//In build.gradle  compile project(':LibProjects:samplelibrary') has to be enabled in depedencies
//Similarly multiple libraries can be added.
//Secondly if the library is present in the same directory level then the below line is to be added
//include ':samplelibrary'//comment out this line.
//In build.gradle compile project(':samplelibrary') has to be enabled in depedencies
